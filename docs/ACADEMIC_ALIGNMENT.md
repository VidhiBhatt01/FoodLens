# 🎓 Academic Alignment and Motivation

FoodLens serves both as a practical sustainability tool for the UCLA community and as a direct engagement with core themes from **CS 269**. The system integrates interpretability, ethical reasoning, and responsible deployment practices throughout its design.



## 🔍 1. Mechanistic Interpretability

FoodLens intentionally avoids opaque, high-capacity neural models.  
Instead, it uses a **fully interpretable decision-tree–based predictor**, whose structure is:

- exported as JSON,
- human-readable and inspectable,
- paired with explanation traces,
- reproducible and auditable.

Each recommendation includes a transparent breakdown of the factors influencing the prediction, directly reflecting the objectives of mechanistic interpretability.



## ⚖️ 2. Computational Ethics and Fairness

Ethical considerations guide the platform’s functionality and constraints:

- opt-in, user-controlled notification preferences,
- dietary filters to support inclusivity,
- minimal data collection and no real-time tracking,
- accessible UI design for equitable use across the student body.

These choices ensure the system does not systematically advantage or disadvantage any group and align with fairness and ethics discussions emphasized in CS 269.



## 🛡️ 3. AI Safety and Responsible Deployment

FoodLens deliberately avoids high-risk automation or behavior-shaping mechanisms.  
In particular, the system does **not** use:

- continuous user monitoring,
- hidden ranking or prioritization algorithms,
- opaque or non-explainable decision pipelines.

The predictor is strictly advisory.  
All outputs are accompanied by concise explanations, making the system’s behavior predictable, transparent, and safe consistent with core AI safety principles.



## 🌱 4. Social Impact and Sustainability

The project contributes to broader campus and societal goals:

- reducing food surplus at UCLA events,
- promoting ethical consumption,
- supporting resource-efficient event planning,
- improving community access to leftover food.

This demonstrates how interpretable AI can serve as an effective tool for positive social impact.



## 📘 5. Scope and Capstone Appropriateness

FoodLens balances academic depth with practical feasibility. The work includes:

- end-to-end system design,
- interpretable machine-learning methods,
- explainability artifacts,
- ethical reasoning and constraint justification,
- geospatial visualization and UI/UX design,
- synthetic data generation and model evaluation.

The project remains well-scoped for a 10-week academic quarter while offering meaningful opportunities for technical and ethical analysis.



## 🎯 Conclusion

FoodLens illustrates how interpretable and ethically grounded AI systems can address real problems at campus scale. The project operationalizes key themes from CS 269 through a responsible, transparent, and community-oriented design.
