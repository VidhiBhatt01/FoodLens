## 🎓 Academic Alignment and Motivation

FoodLens is designed not only as a practical sustainability tool for the UCLA community but also as a direct engagement with core themes presented in **CS 269**. The project integrates AI transparency, ethical reasoning, and responsible deployment throughout its workflow.

---

### 🔍 1. Mechanistic Interpretability

FoodLens intentionally avoids opaque neural models.  
Instead, it uses a **custom interpretable decision-tree predictor** whose full structure is:

• exported as JSON  
• human-readable  
• paired with explanation traces  
• reproducible and auditable  

Every recommendation explicitly shows *which features contributed to the outcome*, reflecting the core goals of mechanistic interpretability.

---

### ⚖️ 2. Computational Ethics and Fairness

The platform incorporates ethical reasoning at the design level:

• opt-in notification preferences  
• dietary filters for inclusivity  
• non-intrusive email-based alerts  
• choice **not** to use real-time tracking  
• accessible UI design for equitable access  

These decisions ensure that visibility of food opportunities does not disadvantage any student group and aligns with computational ethics discussions from CS 269.

### 🛡️ 3. AI Safety and Responsible Deployment

FoodLens avoids high-risk automation, including:

• no continuous monitoring of user location  
• no behavior-shaping or ranking algorithms  
• no hidden prioritization rules  

The predictor is **advisory**, not prescriptive.  
Every prediction includes a clear rationale, making the system predictable, transparent, and safe — consistent with AI safety principles emphasized in the course.

### 🌱 4. Social Impact and Sustainability

By reducing food surplus and enabling redistribution, FoodLens aligns with:

• campus sustainability initiatives  
• ethical consumption practices  
• resource-efficient event planning  
• community welfare and food accessibility  

This demonstrates how interpretable AI can support positive social outcomes at a campus scale.

---

### 📘 5. Scope Appropriate for Capstone Evaluation

FoodLens balances academic rigor with practical implementation, combining:

• system design  
• ethical reasoning  
• interpretable ML  
• UI/UX design  
• synthetic data creation  
• mapping and geospatial integration  

The project remains **fully achievable within a 10-week quarter**, while still providing meaningful depth for evaluation.

### 🎯 Conclusion

FoodLens shows how **interpretable and ethically grounded AI** can address a tangible real-world challenge.
